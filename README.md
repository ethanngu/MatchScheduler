# Match Scheduler
## An application in which one can schedule a series of matches composed of randomly selected participants

This application, when given a list of participants, will randomly set them up in a one on one match. If given a odd number of participants, the program will randomly 
choose one to be on break, before scheduling the rest. 

This program is great for recreational use or for fairly determining match ups for a tournament.
